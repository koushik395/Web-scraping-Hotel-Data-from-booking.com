# Web-scraping-Hotel-Data-from-booking.com

The hotel industry is continuously growing for the last 15 years since the last recession. With growth, competition has also increased in the industry.Every other day market welcomes new vendors and with that profit margins get narrow for the old vendors. So, it has become quite challenging for the OTAs to keep up with the booking revenue.<br>
But OTAs can overcome this problem by tracking their competitorâ€™s pricing. But the question is how can you track them? Well, here not only web scraping can help you track your competitors but will also improve your revenue.<br>
Now we are going to scrape booking.com with python. By the end,we will be able to scrape prices and other details of any hotel from booking.com

These are the following data points that we are going to scrape from the target website.

* Address
* Name
* Pricing
* Rating
* Room Type
* Facilities
* Room sqft

Obviously, hotel data scraping goes beyond this and this was just an example of how python can be used for scraping Booking.com for price comparison purposes. You can use Python for scraping other websites like Expedia, Hotels.com, etc.<br>
But scraping at scale would not be possible with this process. After some time booking.com will block your IP and your data pipeline will be blocked permanently. For seamless scraping use Web Scraping API which will rotate IPs on every new request and will use headless chrome to reduce any chance of blockage.
